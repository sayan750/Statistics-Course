    "**Bayes's theorem is a mathematical formula that helps calculate the probability of an event occurring, given some prior knowledge or evidence.

The test has a 90% accuracy rate, meaning it correctly identifies 90% of people with the disease and 10% of people without it. If a person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have it?**\n",
