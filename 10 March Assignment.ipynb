For example, if we want to estimate the mean height of all people in a certain country, we might take a sample of 100 people and calculate the sample mean height, which would be our point estimate of the population mean height.**\n",

For example, we might calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height based on our sample data. This interval would provide us with a range of values that we can be 95% confident contains the true population mean height.**"
